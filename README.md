After Several days of confusion in installing Detectron2 on windows, I finally installed it. So here I've decided to show you the path that I went through.




## ðŸ›  Pycocotools

## ðŸ›  Installation

First , the Detectron2 repository must be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)
or simply use:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git
```
Next, changes must be made in **5 files** which their names are in following paths:
- `local_path/detectron2/utils/collect_env.py`
- `local_path/detectron2/engine/defaults.py`
- `local_path/detectron2/evaluation/evaluator.py`
- `local_path/detectron2/layers/csrc/cocoeval/cocoeval.cpp`
- `local_path/detectron2/layers/csrc/nms_rotated/nms_rotated_cuda.cu`
Please **replace** the modified files in this repo with yours. 

Use this command to install Detectron2
```bash

## ðŸ›  Correct unix paths
There is one more thing to do. we should refine unix paths which are `/` to windows `\`, we 
* __step1__ :
 download `iopath`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/iopath --single-branch --branch v0.1.8
```
* __step 2__:  
open `iopath/iopath/common/file_io.py` 
file, in class `HTTPURLHandler` and it's `_get_local_path` method,  in line 753 replace:
* `filename = path.split("/")[-1]`

with:
* `filename = parsed_url.path.split("/")[-1]`


* __step 3__ :  
Open a terminal with administrator premission, go to your local `iopath` repository and run following command:

```bash
pip install -e iopath
```

Hope you can use these instructions to easily install Detectron2. To get more information, follow the links.
